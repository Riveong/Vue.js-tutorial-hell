UGHHHH I HATE EVERYTHING!!!!
But it's ok I've been working on my self esteem.
I don't want to hurt my lil heart anymore :(
I just wanna be happy without any attachment to someone or anyone.

anyways I have 3 coping mechanism:
> - Gaming
> - Watching comfy anime
> - Code

Therefore I'm here to cope with everything that I can find, In this case Vue.js

    <script>
    Vue.createApp({
    data(){
	    return{
		    pageTitle: 'HI GUYS',
			inside:'mewmewmeowmeow idk'
		};
	  }
    }).mount('#content');
    
    </script>

So the pageTitle and inside from HTML are dynamic because we can change the value of them.
